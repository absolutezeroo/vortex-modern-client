/**
 * Re-encodes an additive sprite's darkness as transparency.
 *
 * A glow — a spotlight cone, a halo, a firework — is authored as light on black and drawn with
 * an additive blend, which on screen makes the black contribute nothing. Composited onto a
 * *transparent* canvas instead, there is nothing for it to add to: canvas 2D's `lighter` adds
 * alpha along with colour, so the black stays and the effect comes out as a dark blob. That is
 * what `/habbo-imaging/effect/1.png` looked like before this existed.
 *
 * The engine has the same problem and the same answer —
 * `RoomObjectSpriteVisualization.extractDarknessToAlpha()`, itself a port of AS3's per-pixel
 * `BitmapData.getVector()`/`setVector()` loop. A pixel darker than mid-lightness has its
 * lightness lifted to 128 and its alpha scaled by how dark it was, so black becomes fully
 * transparent and a half-lit pixel keeps half its opacity. This is that loop, with the engine's
 * own `ColorConverter` doing the HSL maths so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * @see packages/vortex-engine/src/room/object/visualization/RoomObjectSpriteVisualization.ts::extractDarknessToAlpha()
