/**
 * Renders furniture and whole rooms out of the client's own room pipeline.
 *
 * Two routes, one mechanism. A furni preview is a room with a single object in it at the
 * origin; a room render is the same room with the plane object and every stored item added.
 * Both end in `render/composeSprites.ts`, which draws what the visualizations produced.
 *
 * The placement maths below is `RoomRenderingCanvas.renderObject()` and the room set-up is
 * `RoomEngine.initializeRoom()` / `addRoomObjectFurniture()` / `addRoomObjectWallItem()` —
 * cited at each step. Nothing here decides how a furni looks; that is the visualization's job,
 * and it is the client's class doing it.
