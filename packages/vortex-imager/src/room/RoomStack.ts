/**
 * Boots the client's room-object pipeline headlessly.
 *
 * Same principle as `AvatarRenderService`: nothing here reimplements a visualization.
 * `RoomContentLoader`, `RoomObjectFactory`, `RoomObjectVisualizationFactory`, `RoomManager`
 * and the forty-odd `Furniture*Visualization` classes are the engine's own, running unmodified
 * — only the browser APIs under them are replaced (`shim/`). A furni imager that reinvents the
 * layer/direction/colour rules drifts from the room the first time either side is touched, and
 * the drift shows up as a catalog thumbnail that does not match the item you just placed.
 *
 * What is *not* booted is `RoomEngine`. It is a DI `Component` with hard dependencies on the
 * window manager, the toolbar, the catalog and the session manager; a hard dependency on an
 * IID nothing provides locks a component forever with nothing logged. So the four collaborators
 * it would have wired are wired here directly — which is all `RoomEngine.getFurnitureImage()`
 * actually uses them for.
 *
 * The one thing this class cannot borrow is the rasterizer.
 * `RoomObjectSpriteVisualization.getImage()` and `RoomRenderingCanvas` both end at
 * `Vortex.instance.application.renderer.extract.canvas()`, and there is no PixiJS renderer in
 * Node. The sprites themselves are plain data (`getSprite(i)` → texture + offset + depth +
 * tint), so `render/composeSprites.ts` draws them on a 2D canvas instead — which is what AS3's
 * own `BitmapData.draw()` loop did before PixiJS existed.
