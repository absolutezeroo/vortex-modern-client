/**
 * Keeps rendered PNGs on disk, so a restart does not re-render the hotel.
 *
 * Only the routes whose URL fully describes their pixels get one: a figure string, a badge code
 * and a furni's class plus its parameters are the whole input, so the same key can only ever
 * produce the same bytes. A room is the opposite — `room/7.png` names a room whose contents
 * change whenever someone moves a chair — and it stays memory-only with a short TTL.
 *
 * The one thing that *can* change an otherwise-immutable image is the hotel updating its assets:
 * the same figure renders differently once the clothing bundles are rebuilt. So the build is
 * part of the path (`<dir>/<build>/…`), taken from `flash.client.url`, which carries the asset
 * folder's name. A new build writes into a new directory and the old one simply stops being
 * read; deleting it is the whole of cache invalidation.
