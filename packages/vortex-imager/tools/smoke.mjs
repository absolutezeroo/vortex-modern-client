/**
 * Asks a running imager for one of everything and checks it got an image back.
 *
 * This is the check the room pipeline needs, and it is deliberately end-to-end rather than a
 * unit test of any one function. Every failure this package has actually had was a silent one —
 * a blank floor, a placeholder box, a boot that hung with six successful downloads behind it —
 * and none of them would have failed an assertion about a parser. What catches them is asking
 * for a picture and looking at whether one came back.
 *
 *   node tools/smoke.mjs [baseUrl] [roomId]
 *
 * Room cases are skipped, not failed, when the service reports no database, or when the room id
 * does not exist on this hotel: `?figure=` and the furniture routes are meant to work without a
 * database, and which rooms exist is fixture data, not behaviour. Pass a room id that has some
 * furniture in it to make the room cases mean something.
