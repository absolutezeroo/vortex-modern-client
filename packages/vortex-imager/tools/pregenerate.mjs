/**
 * Bakes the imager's output to static PNGs, the way a real hotel ships `hof_furni`.
 *
 *   node tools/pregenerate.mjs --furni --avatars --badges
 *
 * It renders nothing itself: it asks the running imager over HTTP, which is the only way the
 * baked bytes are guaranteed to be the bytes the live route would have produced — every
 * parameter default, every cache tier and the PNG encoder are the service's, not a second
 * implementation of them here. `pnpm dev` and `pnpm web` start that service, so it is already up.
 *
 * The file names come from `imagingKey()` in `vite-plugin-imager.mjs`, which is also what serves
 * them, so the two cannot disagree about where an image lives.
 *
 * What goes stale, and when:
 *   - furni: on an asset build. Delete the directory and re-run.
 *   - badges: when a guild edits its badge. Cheap enough to re-run whenever.
 *   - avatars: the moment a player changes clothes. A stale file is served until the next run —
 *     that is the trade for serving it with nothing running. Re-run it, or delete that one file.
