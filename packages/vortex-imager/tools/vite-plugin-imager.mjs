/**
 * Starts the imager alongside a Vite dev server.
 *
 * Both dev servers already proxy `/habbo-imaging` to :8081, so an imager that is not running is
 * not an error anyone sees — it is avatars and badges that silently do not draw, and a second
 * terminal to remember. This plugin removes the second terminal: `pnpm dev` and `pnpm web` each
 * bring the service up themselves.
 *
 * It probes the port first rather than owning the process, because both dev servers load this
 * plugin and `pnpm imager` is still the way to run the service on its own. Whoever is already
 * listening keeps the port; the others attach to nothing and let the proxy do the rest.
 * `src/index.ts` handles the remaining race — two dev servers started in the same second both
 * see a free port — by exiting quietly on EADDRINUSE instead of throwing a stack.
