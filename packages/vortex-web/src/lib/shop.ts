//
// The API answers a product as a KIND and an AMOUNT — `{kind: 0, amount: 100}` — and never a label,
// because a label is a language and the hotel has several. The wording is assembled here, from
// habbo.com's own keys where one exists (`SHOP_CREDITS_TITLE`, `SHOP_OFFERINGS_HABBO_CLUB_TITLE`),
// so a second language is a translation and not a second copy of this logic.
//
// Prices are integer MINOR units with an ISO currency beside them — 450 EUR-minor is 4,50 € — which
// is the only representation of money that does not eventually lose a cent. `Intl.NumberFormat`
// turns that into the visitor's own notation, so nothing here formats a currency by hand.
