// habbo.com draws every piece of site chrome — the logo, the five navigation icons, the purse
// currencies, the user menu, the social links — out of one 473 KB sheet. The coordinates below are
// the `background-position` / `width` / `height` triples read straight off `mockup/habbo.css`, so
// this table IS the sheet's index; nothing here was measured by eye.
//
// Sprite.svelte turns an entry into an element. Positions are stored POSITIVE and negated there,
// which is the only cosmetic change from the source (`-552px -359px` -> `[552, 359]`).
//
// Three-state entries (idle / hover / active) are the navigation and user-menu links: habbo.com
// swaps the icon on :hover and .active, and an icon that stays put on hover is the tell that a state
// was dropped.
