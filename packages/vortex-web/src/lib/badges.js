// Badge labels.
//
// The hotel's badge texts are in no database and no API answers them: they live in
// `gamedata/<lang>/external_flash_texts.json` on the asset host, which is where the CLIENT reads
// them from too — `badge_<code>_name` and `badge_<code>_desc`, with a handful of older badges
// spelling it `badge_name_<code>` / `badge_desc_<code>` instead. Both are tried, and an unknown code
// falls back to the code itself rather than to an empty label, which would read as a broken badge.
//
// It is a ~1MB file, fetched at most once per page load and shared by every caller (the promise is
// the cache, so ten badges rendering at once are one request). It is only ever loaded by a page that
// actually shows a badge.
