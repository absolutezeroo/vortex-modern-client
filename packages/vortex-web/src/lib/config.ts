// (promo art, badge icons, room thumbnails) and has no session to keep same-origin.

// c_images is PROXIED like /api and /habbo-imaging, not addressed absolutely. It used to point
// straight at `http://vortex-assets.local`, which only works on the machine whose hosts file knows
// that name: open the site from a phone on the same network and every promo image, badge and room
// shot 404s, because the phone resolves the URL, not the dev server. Going through the proxy makes
// the page work from any device, and in production a reverse proxy answers the same path.
//
// VITE_ASSET_BASE still overrides it, for a deployment that serves c_images from a CDN.

// The appart render, and WHERE it goes is the whole of what this comment is for, because the port
// got it wrong in both directions before settling here.
//
// habbo.com has three appart pictures and they are not the same picture:
//
//   .room-item__thumbnail__image   the gallery card's 110px plate
//   .room__thumbnail__image        the room page's 114px plate
//   <habbo-room-picture>           the full-width band UNDER the room page
//
// All three read a field on the room — `room.thumbnailUrl` / `room.imageUrl` — which is a PHOTO,
// taken in-game with the camera and chosen by the owner. Nothing here answers that field, and the
// camera is not ported, so the two THUMBNAILS keep the default plate the sprite sheet already
// carries (`::before` on both classes — what habbo.com shows underneath when a room has no photo).
//
// The full-width band is the one that gets the render. packages/vortex-imager draws the appart's
// actual furniture through the client's own renderer at `GET /habbo-imaging/room/:id`, and that band
// is a big empty rectangle without it. A render is not the photo habbo.com puts there, but it is the
// same subject at the same size in the same slot — where on a 110px plate it was a different kind of
// picture standing in for one nobody took.
