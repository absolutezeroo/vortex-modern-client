<!-- `.profile__header`: a room shot behind the avatar, name and motto, `left bottom / 100%` and
     `image-rendering: pixelated` — it IS pixel art, and smoothing it turns the tiles to mush. The
     `::before` under it is a 2px gradient, which is what stops the band ending on a hard line.

     DEVIATION: habbo.com hangs this on the SMALL HEADER itself
     (`<habbo-header-small class="profile__header">`), so the room art runs behind the logo and the
     navigation as one continuous band — `habbo-header-small{background:#069}` is what it replaces.
     Here the header and the navigation are rendered by `App.svelte` for every route, and reaching
     up to repaint them from one page would mean a store or prop-drilling through the shell for a
     background image. The band therefore starts below the navigation. Its own proportions are
     habbo.com's exactly, which is what puts the avatar, the name and the motto where they belong. -->

    <!-- `profile-header.html`, and the port had almost none of it:
         `.profile-header__avatar` reserves 46px and `align-self: flex-start`, while
         `.profile-header__image` inside it is 104 wide with `margin-left:16px; margin-right:24px`
         and a `::before` 88px disc at (-16, 24) — so the avatar OVERFLOWS its slot and tucks under
         the details plate, which reserves 58px of left padding for exactly that.

         `.profile-header__details` is the part that was missing entirely: a translucent black plate
         (rgba(0,0,0,.5), rounded 3px, 500px wide) holding the name and the motto. Without it the
         name sat on the room art with nothing behind it.

         And `.profile-header__details h1{text-transform:none}` — this is the one h1 on the site that
         keeps its case. It was rendering "ADMIN" where habbo.com renders "Admin". -->

         whole of the band's proportions — this port had a `py-6` strip about half as tall with the
