    // HTML fragment from its CMS and injects it. Same job here, except the fragments are mirrored
    // into src/webpages/ by tools/fetch-web-pages.mjs, so the hotel serves its own copy.
    //
    // The markup that arrives is habbo.com's own — <h1>/<h3>/<p>/<hr> and <img class="align-right">
    // — and it carries no Tailwind classes, because it was never written for this port. That is why
    // `.static-content` is REAL CSS in styles.css rather than utilities: injected HTML cannot be
    // given utility classes without rewriting the CMS's markup, which would defeat mirroring it.
