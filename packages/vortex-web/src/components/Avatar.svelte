    // Rendered by packages/vortex-imager, which runs the client's own avatar pipeline — so a head
    // here is pixel-identical to the same head in a room, which is the whole reason the imager
    // exists rather than a second renderer.
    //
    // `well` is habbo.com's circular head badge (`.user-menu__avatar`, `.item__icon`), and the
    // detail that makes it look right is that the head is BIGGER than the circle and is not clipped
    // by it: habbo.com asks its imager for `size="bighead"` and lays that over a 46px well, so the
    // circle shows as a rim around the jaw rather than as a frame the head sits inside. Clipping a
    // 1x head into the circle — what this component did first — gives a small face in a dark disc,
    // which is the thing that reads as "not Habbo".
    //
    // So the well asks for `size=l` (the imager's zoom 2: a 180x260 canvas) and positions it by the
    // head's own centre. Both numbers below are measured off the alpha bounding box of a rendered
    // `headonly=1` at that size — box x 52-117, y 72-141 — not guessed.

    // the closest source: a 180x260 canvas whose head measures 66x70 with its centre at (85, 107),
    // all four numbers measured off the alpha bounding box of a rendered `headonly=1`.
    //
    // The head is then drawn a touch LARGER than the well (1.06), which is what leaves the circle
    // showing as a rim around the jaw instead of a frame the face sits inside. At 1x it is far too
    // small for the circle; at full 2x it swamps it.
