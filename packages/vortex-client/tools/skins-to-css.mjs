/**
 * skins-to-css — turns the shipped Habbo window skins into a plain CSS stylesheet.
 *
 * WHY
 * ---
 * The skins are the only thing that makes the client look like Habbo, and they are
 * pure data: `src/assets/window-skins/*.xml` says which rectangle of which atlas
 * PNG each piece comes from and how it scales. Nothing about that needs a canvas
 * renderer. Emitting it as CSS lets an ordinary HTML app (the emulator's Svelte
 * dashboard) wear the same skin without adopting the window system — and without
 * inheriting its costs: no auto-sizing buttons, no manual relayout, no
 * virtualisation, and text stays selectable.
 *
 * THE MAPPING
 * -----------
 * A skin file has two halves that must not be confused:
 *
 *   <templates>  where each named piece lives IN THE ATLAS (the source rect)
 *   <layouts>    where it is drawn IN THE WINDOW at design size, plus how it
 *                scales: `fixed` (pinned to the near edge), `move` (pinned to the
 *                far edge) or `strech` (fills the space between).
 *
 * `border-image` is NOT a general answer. It takes four slice numbers, so it can
 * only express a regular 3x3 grid, and plenty of skins are not one:
 * illumina_light_skin_border_raised has 4px rounded corners but 1px straight
 * edges, and stacks TWO 9-slices (an outer `border_` and an inner, recolourable
 * `background_`). So each piece is cut out of the atlas at build time and emitted
 * as its own background layer, which reproduces fixed/move/strech exactly:
 *
 *   fixed  x fixed   ->  no-repeat at that corner, natural size
 *   strech x fixed   ->  no-repeat at (left offset, edge), size calc(100% - L - R)
 *   strech x strech  ->  the centre, stretched both ways
 *
 * Pieces are inlined as data: URIs, so the output is one self-contained file with
 * no assets to deploy. They are a few dozen bytes each.
 *
 * `colorize="true"` pieces are tinted by the window's colour at runtime. Those
 * become `mask-image` layers over a `background-color`, so a CSS variable drives
 * the tint the same way.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node tools/skins-to-css.mjs                      # every skin
 *   node tools/skins-to-css.mjs --skin illumina_light_skin_border_raised
 *   node tools/skins-to-css.mjs --out ../../dist/habbo-skin.css
