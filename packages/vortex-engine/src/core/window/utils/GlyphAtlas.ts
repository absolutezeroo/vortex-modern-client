 * step — which is also the only place the four AS3 text-quality fields can
 * mean anything:
 *
 * - `antiAliasType` (`TextController.as::get antiAliasType()`) — Flash's
 *   `"normal"` is the pre-Flash-8 rasteriser: on a pixel font at its design
 *   size it produces essentially binary coverage, which is the crisp look the
 *   Habbo UI was authored against (`text_styles_css` sets `normal` on every
 *   Volter 9px style). Skia instead applies greyscale AA, so `"normal"` is
 *   reproduced here by supersampling and then sampling the CENTRE of each
 *   destination pixel — the literal "does the outline cover the pixel centre"
 *   test an aliased rasteriser performs. Averaging the supersamples instead
 *   would defeat the purpose: a half-pixel-wide stem averages to ~50% alpha
 *   and is then destroyed by the threshold, which is what mangles glyphs like
 *   `M` at 9px.
 * - `sharpness` / `thickness` (`::get sharpness()`, `::get thickness()`) —
 *   Flash's two `"advanced"` AA knobs, applied here as a contrast slope and a
 *   threshold bias on the alpha channel.
 * - `gridFitType` (`::get gridFitType()`) — `"pixel"` snaps glyph origins and
 *   advances to whole pixels.
 *
 * All of that is applied ONCE, at bake time, into the atlas page. Drawing is
 * then one `drawImage()` per glyph with no per-draw measuring, no per-draw
 * canvas, and no per-draw pixel work.
