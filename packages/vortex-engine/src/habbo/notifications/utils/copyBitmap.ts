/**
 * Copies an `ImageBitmap` so a notification can own it.
 *
 * **A bubble closes the icon it is given.** `SingularNotificationController` builds its
 * `HabboNotificationItemStyle` with `ownsIcon` true, and that style's `dispose()` calls
 * `icon.close()` when the bubble expires. That is AS3's own contract — Flash passed `BitmapData` by
 * reference and made disposal the owner's job — and it is safe for a caller that composed the image
 * itself. It is not safe for a caller handing over an asset out of the library.
 *
 * Doing that destroys the asset for the rest of the session. The `ImageBitmap` detaches, every later
 * `drawImage` of it throws `InvalidStateError: The image source is detached`, and because the throw
 * happens **inside a paint** the frame aborts: what the user sees is not a missing icon but a window
 * stranded half-drawn and the tooltips dead beside it. It cost the Fish-O-Pedia, whose species
 * previews are the same sprites the catch bubble borrowed.
 *
 * So: copy at every call site that passes a library asset. `RewardTrackController` and
 * `HabboFishing` are the two that do.
 *
 * @param source The library asset, or null.
 * @returns A private copy the notification may close, or null.
