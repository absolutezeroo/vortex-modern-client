/**
 * NotificationExtraDataKey
 *
 * The keys a notification's `extraData` bag may carry. AS3 declares them as a constants class so
 * the producers (wired, the catalog, the friend bar) and the consumers (the item view's display
 * time, `hasNotificationById()`'s dedup) agree without sharing a type.
 *
 * Two of the seven are obfuscated in every tree and are named after the string they hold, which is
 * the string the consumers actually match on — see the individual notes.
 *
