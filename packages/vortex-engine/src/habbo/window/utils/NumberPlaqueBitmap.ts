/**
 * Renders a number as the little glyph strip on a rare's plaque — the serial number on a limited
 * edition, the contents count on a chest.
 *
 * Name DERIVED, not recovered: the class is `_SafeCls_4213` in the primary tree and does not exist
 * in the 2016 one. `createBitmap` and `GLYPH_ASSET_PREFIX` are real.
 *
 * The digits are not a font. Each is its own image, and they are proportional — "1" is 3px wide
 * where every other digit is 5 — which is why the strip is measured before it is drawn rather than
 * laid out on a fixed pitch. AS3's leading-zero suppression is written out as five nested tests
 * rather than a loop; the shape here is the same, just expressed as one.
 *
 * These ten names do not exist as files in the WIN63 dump. The manifest declares them as regions
 * inside `unique_item_label_number_glyphs.png`, and `tools/import-manifest-subassets.mjs` cuts them
 * out at build time, which is why an ordinary lookup finds them.
 *
 * AS3: sources/WIN63-202607011411-782849652/src/com/sulake/habbo/window/utils/_SafeCls_4213.as
