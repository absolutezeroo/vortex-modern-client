/**
 * Synthetic room load, driven entirely client-side, for reading the `:showstats` frame budget
 * under a controlled number of moving avatars.
 *
 * TS-only: no AS3 counterpart — Flash had no such tool, and this exists to answer a question about
 * this port's own rendering, not about the original client's.
 *
 * **Why a client-side one exists at all**, next to loading the real server with bots: a full-stack
 * test cannot tell you *which* stage got slower. Bots on the server move the `net` channel (their
 * status updates), the `room` channel (sprite updates and the per-frame sort) and `pixi` (draw
 * submission) all at once. This one emits no packets whatsoever — it drives `IRoomEngine` directly —
 * so it is the render-only baseline. Run both at the same avatar count and the difference is the
 * cost of the wire.
 *
 * The avatars here take the same code path a server-driven avatar does. `updateRoomObjectUser()`
 * with a target is exactly what `RoomMessageHandler.onWiredUserMove()` calls on a real status
 * update, and the `'mv'` posture is what `setUserMovePosture()` sets alongside it — the port does no
 * client-side pathfinding, it animates the slide it is told about. So no walkable-tile logic is
 * needed for the load to be representative: a bot sliding to an unreachable tile exercises the same
 * visualization, cache and sort work as one walking a legal path.
 *
 * What it does **not** reproduce: server-side pathing, packet volume, and any per-user data the
 * session manager would hold. It is a rendering load, and only that.
