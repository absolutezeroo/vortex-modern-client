/**
 * Orders every room-preview canvas on the shared PixiJS stage.
 *
 * TS-only, and it exists because of a deviation this port already carries:
 * `RoomEngine.createRoomCanvas()` parents a preview canvas directly onto the
 * root stage instead of into the window that hosts it. In AS3 the canvas is a
 * child of the widget's own window (`RoomPreviewerWidget.as`), so Flash's
 * display list orders these for free and nothing like this class is needed.
 *
 * Parented onto the stage, the canvases are siblings of each other AND of the
 * main room view, with no knowledge of the window z-order — so each previewer
 * used to re-assert front-of-stage for itself on every frame. That is right
 * with one previewer (it does have to sit above the room view) and wrong with
 * two: the inventory's and the catalog's fought over the same top slot, and
 * whichever synced last covered the other wherever their screen rects
 * overlapped. Dragging the inventory over the catalog's preview showed the
 * CATALOG's furniture inside the inventory's frame; clicking between the two
 * windows reshuffled it, which is what made it look intermittent.
 *
 * No canvas can resolve that alone — they cannot see each other. So they all
 * register here, and this class lifts them above the rest of the stage while
 * ordering them among themselves by their host windows' depth: the answer the
 * window system would have given had these been ordinary child windows.
