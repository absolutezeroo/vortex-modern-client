 * class is `_SafeCls_3475`) and corroborated by the emulator, which implements the composer.
 *
 * `win63_version` is cited only for the readable class name: this message is obfuscated in the
 * primary tree, which is where every member trace below points, because that tree is the
 * authority on behaviour and this one has shipped two bad decompiles today alone.
