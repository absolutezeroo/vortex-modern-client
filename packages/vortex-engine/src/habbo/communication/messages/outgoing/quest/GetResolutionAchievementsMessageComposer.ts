/**
 * Ask for the achievements a resolution furni can be set to — header 1760 in WIN63's registry
 * (`_SafeCls_2046.as::_composers[1760]`).
 *
 * **The second field does double duty.** Sent as 0 it means "just give me the list"; sent with an
 * achievement id it *commits* that choice, which is what the resolution window's save button does.
 * Same header, same shape, two meanings — so the default matters.
 *
 * `AchievementsResolutionController` sends the 0 form on every event that could have moved the
 * player's progress (a level-up or a completed achievement matching the one on screen), which is how
 * the progress view refreshes without a message of its own.
 *
 * Name RECOVERED from
 * sources/win63_version/habbo/communication/messages/outgoing/game/lobby/GetResolutionAchievementsMessageComposer.as
 * — that tree is obfuscated too, but it is the one where messages keep readable filenames.
