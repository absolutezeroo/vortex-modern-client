    //   server's 3D height map it no longer is - the floor under a platform and the platform's top
    //   are the same (x, y), so "walk up onto it" and "walk down under it" arrived identical and
    //   the server had to guess, which it did by always taking the highest reachable surface. A
    //   third field carries the altitude actually clicked. Hundredths of a tile height, because
    //   that is the unit RoomPathingSystem already keys altitudes by (ZKeyOf). The server reads it
    //   only if present, so a two-int sender still parses.
