/**
 * Turns the own avatar to face a tile. Sent when a user is selected by clicking their avatar or
 * their chat bubble, unless a click-user wired trigger owns the click.
 *
 * Header 2508, from WIN63's own registry (`habbo/communication/_SafeCls_2046.as:819`). The
 * emulator does NOT corroborate: it maps its own `LookToMessageEvent` to 9103, a placeholder its
 * comment already flags as UNRESOLVED and a pre-existing mismatch. Its parser reads the same two
 * ints in the same order, so only the header is wrong there.
 *
 * `win63_version` is cited only for the readable class name: this message is obfuscated in the
 * primary tree, which is where every member trace below points, because that tree is the
 * authority on behaviour and this one has shipped two bad decompiles today alone.
