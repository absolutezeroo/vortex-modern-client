 *
 * Header 4100, from WIN63's registry (`_SafeCls_2046.as::_composers[4100]`). Corroborated by
 * vortex-emulator's `GetDailyTasksEvent = 4100`.
 *
 * `initSessionData()` sends exactly two payload-less composers back to back — this one and
 * `_SafeCls_1848` (3642), already ported as `GetUserNftChatStylesMessageComposer`. They are
 * distinguishable only by header, so the pairing was confirmed against both the registry and
 * the emulator rather than by position.
 *
 * The name comes from vortex-emulator; no unobfuscated tree carries this composer.
