/**
 * Downscaling that halves repeatedly instead of resizing once.
 *
 * A single `drawImage` from 4x to 1x samples four source pixels per destination pixel and throws
 * the rest away; halving three times averages all sixteen. The difference is visible on habbicon
 * previews, which are drawn at 0.5x.
 *
 * **The class name is unrecoverable from any tree** — `_SafeCls_2871` in the primary, `class_2495`
 * in `win63_version`, absent from PRODUCTION. The *method* name is real in both obfuscated trees;
 * only the class wrapping it is not, so this file is named for what it holds.
 *
 * `AvatarImage` carries its own private copy of the same algorithm, written before this file
 * existed. Left alone: it is private, correct, and merging the two is a refactor of the avatar
 * pipeline, not of habbicons.
