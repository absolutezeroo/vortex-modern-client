/**
 * The browser stand-in for `flash.external.ExternalInterface`, for the two ad providers.
 *
 * Flash reached the surrounding page two ways: `call(name, …)` invoked a page function, and
 * `addCallback(name, fn)` published one for the page to invoke back. Both become plain `window`
 * properties under the *same dotted names*, because the contract is the page's — a page written
 * for the Flash client keeps working, and one that defines nothing leaves every call inert.
 *
 * The same technique `MallOfferExternalInterfaceHelper` already uses; it is shared here because
 * `SupersonicProvider` and `SponsorPayProvider` publish eleven callbacks between them.
 *
 * TS-only: no AS3 counterpart — AS3 has ExternalInterface.
