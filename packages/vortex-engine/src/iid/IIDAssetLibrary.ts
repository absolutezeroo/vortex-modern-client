 * asset library directly through its constructor parameter instead. This port
 * threads one shared AssetLibrary through the DI container (see VortexMain.ts and
 * habbo/avatar/AvatarRenderManager.ts) rather than passing it down every
 * constructor in the dependency graph, which AS3's simpler single-context
 * assumption doesn't require it to do.
