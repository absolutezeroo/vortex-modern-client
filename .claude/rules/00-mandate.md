# Mandatory: read before coding

Before writing any implementation code, you MUST complete these steps IN ORDER:

1. **Read the AS3 source file** — Find and read the corresponding AS3 file IN ITS ENTIRETY
   - Primary: `sources/WIN63-202607011411-782849652/src/com/sulake/<module>/<Class>.as`
   - Secondary: `sources/win63_version/<module>/<Class>.as`
   - Tertiary: `sources/PRODUCTION-201601012205-226667486/src/com/sulake/habbo/<module>/<Class>.as`
   - **Never invent a name for an obfuscated identifier.** `win63_version` will not recover it — that tree is obfuscated too, with a different scheme. Only PRODUCTION is unobfuscated, and only for classes that existed in 2016. See CLAUDE.md → "AS3 sources" for how to identify a class, and what to do when a name exists in no tree (say so at the declaration; never pass a derived name off as recovered).
2. **Read the AS3 interface** — `I<Class>.as` + `handler/` directory if present
3. **Check `docs/PATTERNS.md`** if implementing a Composer, Parser, Event, Manager, or UI Window
4. **Check `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`** for the current module status
5. **Read `docs/CLIENT-SERVER-ARCHITECTURE.md`** if touching anything in `habbo/communication/` (composers, parsers, message events/IDs) or any feature that sends/receives network messages — it documents how this client is expected to talk to a real Arcturus-Community-style server: the wire protocol, handshake/encryption sequence, message ID conventions, full per-system request/response flows (room, chat, catalog, inventory, trading, etc.), and a list of **known real-server bugs and protocol mismatches**. Some AS3 behavior that looks wrong may actually be a deliberate workaround for a documented server-side bug — check this doc before "fixing" wire-format code in `habbo/communication/`.

If you haven't read the AS3 source, your implementation is invalid. No exceptions.

## Before you delete or replace existing TypeScript

The steps above are about the AS3 side. Most of the damage comes from the other one.

**Read the body of every call you remove, replace, or stop making.** Not its name — its
body. This port's method names are inherited from AS3, and the TS behind them is frequently
narrower, wider, or simply different. A name tells you what someone meant; only the body
tells you what the next line depends on.

This is not hypothetical. `createMainWindow()` ended with `hideMainWindow()`, which does not
hide anything — it detaches the window from its parent, and `showMainWindow()` refuses to
attach a window that already has one. Replacing that call with the `visible = false` the AS3
actually specifies stopped the catalog opening at all. The name lied; the body did not.

Two corollaries, both learned the same way:

- **"This change is inert" is a claim, not an observation.** Verify it or don't write it.
  Threading `catalogType` into `useNonTabbedCatalog()` was described as inert for
  BUILDERS_CLUB. It was the opposite: both navigators shared one window, so the per-type
  answer let BUILDERS_CLUB hide NORMAL's tabs permanently.
- **A faithful change to one member can break because a *different* member is unfaithful.**
  Both examples above were correct AS3 applied on top of a still-flattened structure. When a
  faithful change misbehaves, suspect the structure under it before reverting the change.

## Before you act on a finding from an audit or an agent

Verify it against the source yourself. Findings are claims, and a confident, well-cited claim
is still a claim. In the 2026-07-17 parity audit, 3 of 26 criticals did not survive contact
with the code, and one of them would have broken the client had it been acted on; separately,
several findings were already fixed by the time they were read. Re-checking costs minutes.
See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` → "Cross-module parity audit" for what the failures
looked like and why they were convincing.
