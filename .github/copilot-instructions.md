# Copilot Instructions — Helium

Full TypeScript/PixiJS v8 port of the Habbo Hotel Flash client. Monorepo: `helium-engine` (engine) + `helium-client` (display, UI). The entire Flash client is ported — both logic and display, with original XML layouts converted to JSON. There is no ENGINE/VIEW split and no separate UI framework: AS3 display classes are ported to PixiJS, not replaced.

<!-- BEGIN:GENERATED-RULES -->
## Mandatory: read before coding

Before writing any implementation code, you MUST complete these steps IN ORDER:

1. **Read the AS3 source file** — Find and read the corresponding AS3 file IN ITS ENTIRETY
   - Primary: `sources/win63_2026_crypted_version/src/com/sulake/<module>/<Class>.as` — if an identifier is obfuscated (`_SafeCls_N`, `_SafeStr_N`, ...), cross-reference the same path one level up (`sources/win63_version/<module>/<Class>.as`) to recover the real name; never invent one
   - Secondary: `sources/win63_version/<module>/<Class>.as`
   - Tertiary: `sources/flash_version/com/sulake/habbo/<module>/<Class>.as`
2. **Read the AS3 interface** — `I<Class>.as` + `handler/` directory if present
3. **Check `docs/PATTERNS.md`** if implementing a Composer, Parser, Event, Manager, or UI Window
4. **Check `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`** for the current module status
5. **Read `docs/CLIENT-SERVER-ARCHITECTURE.md`** if touching anything in `habbo/communication/` (composers, parsers, message events/IDs) or any feature that sends/receives network messages — it documents how this client is expected to talk to a real Arcturus-Community-style server: the wire protocol, handshake/encryption sequence, message ID conventions, full per-system request/response flows (room, chat, catalog, inventory, trading, etc.), and a list of **known real-server bugs and protocol mismatches**. Some AS3 behavior that looks wrong may actually be a deliberate workaround for a documented server-side bug — check this doc before "fixing" wire-format code in `habbo/communication/`.

If you haven't read the AS3 source, your implementation is invalid. No exceptions.

## Path aliases

**Engine** (`helium-engine`): `@core/` → `src/core/` | `@habbo/` → `src/habbo/` | `@room/` → `src/room/` | `@iid/` → `src/iid/`

**Client** (`helium-client`): `@core/` `@habbo/` `@room/` `@iid/` → engine src | `@ui/` `@/` → `src/`

## Architecture and critical rules

```
helium-engine                                   helium-client (depends on engine)
├── core/    Low-level, communication          ├── ui/          Flash UI classes (ported)
├── habbo/   Game logic                        ├── window/      Window system (from Flash)
├── room/    Room engine                       ├── display/     Display components (PixiJS)
└── iid/     DI symbols                        └── layouts/     JSON layouts (from Flash XML)
```

Data flow: `Engine emits event → Client display class listens and updates`

## Critical rules

1. **AS3 is the source of truth** — Never invent code. Read `sources/win63_2026_crypted_version/` first, cross-referencing `sources/win63_version/` when identifiers there are obfuscated
2. **Never simplify AS3 architecture** — If AS3 has handlers/interfaces/delegation, implement them exactly
3. **Engine must NEVER import from client** — `helium-engine` has zero UI knowledge
4. **Never override `get events()`** in Component subclasses — breaks the DI event system; use a different property name (e.g. `sessionEvents`)
5. **Use `createObjectInternal()`** not `createRoomObject()` from container (infinite recursion)
6. **Update `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`** after every significant implementation
7. **Performance**: `Set`/`Map` for lookups, no allocations in render loops, cache textures, viewport culling (see `docs/STYLEGUIDE.md` Performance section and `docs/PATTERNS.md` section 0)
8. **Full port**: ALL AS3 files are ported — both logic AND display. Flash XML → JSON. No ENGINE/VIEW distinction
9. **Managers**: DI Component with IID registration, one `I<Manager>` interface per manager (see `docs/PATTERNS.md` → Manager template)

## AS3 traceability

Every TypeScript class, method, accessor, property, interface member, handler, parser, composer, or event ported from AS3 MUST include an `AS3:` source trace comment immediately above the declaration.

Required format:

```ts
// AS3: sources/win63_2026_crypted_version/src/com/sulake/<path>/<Class>.as::<memberName>()
```

For AS3 accessors and properties:

```ts
// AS3: sources/win63_2026_crypted_version/src/com/sulake/<path>/<Class>.as::get propertyName()
// AS3: sources/win63_2026_crypted_version/src/com/sulake/<path>/<Class>.as::propertyName
```

Always trace to the primary (`win63_2026_crypted_version`) path even if the member's identifier had to be recovered by cross-referencing `sources/win63_version/<path>/<Class>.as` — the trace comment must still use a real, human-readable member name, never an obfuscated `_SafeStr_N`/`_SafeCls_N` placeholder.

If the primary source does not contain the member, fall back to `sources/win63_version/...`, then `sources/flash_version/...`, and point the trace at whichever tree actually has it.

Incomplete members still require a compatible TypeScript signature and a `TODO(AS3)` comment with source path, class/member name, and exact remaining behavior. Never silently omit an AS3 member because it is currently unused; incomplete behavior must be visible as a TODO/stub, not missing from the interface.

## Communication rules (`core/communication/`, `habbo/communication/`)

You are editing wire-protocol code (`core/communication/`, `habbo/communication/`).

1. Read `docs/CLIENT-SERVER-ARCHITECTURE.md` in full for the system you are touching (handshake/encryption, or the specific composer/parser's request-response flow) before changing anything here.
2. Check that document's "known real-server bugs and protocol mismatches" list first. AS3 code that looks wrong (odd byte order, a seemingly redundant field, a workaround-looking branch) may be a deliberate compensation for a real Arcturus-Community server bug — verify before "fixing" it.
3. `Parser.parse()` read order and `Composer.getMessageArray()` field order MUST match the AS3 exactly; reordering silently breaks the wire format.
4. See `docs/PATTERNS.md` → MessageComposer / MessageParser / MessageEvent templates before adding a new message type. Quick shape reminder:
   - **Composer**: `extends MessageComposer<TupleType>` with `_data` and `getMessageArray()`
   - **Parser**: `implements IMessageParser` with `flush()` + `parse(wrapper)`
   - **Event**: `extends MessageEvent implements IMessageEvent` with `callback` parameter in constructor

## Window/UI rules (`core/window/`, `habbo/window/`, `**/widgets/**`)

You are editing the ported Flash UI/window system (`core/window/`, `habbo/window/`, `habbo/*/widgets/`, client `window/`).

1. See `docs/PATTERNS.md` → "UI Window (ported from Flash)" and "Component Lifecycle" for the expected class shape. Quick shape reminder: UI Windows are ported from the AS3 `IWindow`/`IFrameWindow` hierarchy using PixiJS + JSON layouts.
2. Never override `get events()` in a Component subclass — it breaks the DI event system. Use a differently named property (e.g. `sessionEvents`).
3. Flash XML layouts are converted to JSON and loaded at runtime (`helium-client/src/assets/window-layouts`, `window-skins`) — do not reintroduce XML parsing.
4. Flash UI windows/dialogs (`IWindow`, `IFrameWindow`, etc.) are ported as TypeScript classes using PixiJS; Flash display components (buttons, text fields, scrollbars, etc.) are ported as PixiJS display objects. Preserve the original AS3 class hierarchy for UI — do not collapse it into a simplified component model.

## Room engine rules (`room/`, `habbo/room/`)

`room/` (generic engine primitives: `data`, `events`, `object`, `renderer`, `utils`) and `habbo/room/` (Habbo-specific room game logic) are different layers — do not confuse them.

1. Use `createObjectInternal()`, never `createRoomObject()`, when creating room objects from a container (the latter recurses infinitely).
2. `renderer/` is a render-loop hot path: no allocations per frame, cache textures by content key, cull objects outside the viewport. See `docs/STYLEGUIDE.md` → Performance.
3. See `docs/PATTERNS.md` for Manager/Handler patterns before adding new room object types.
